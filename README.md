✈️ Airlines Performance and Reliability Dashboard

📊 A Power BI dashboard powered by PostgreSQL that analyzes airline performance, delays, and reliability using real-world data.

🧩 Project Overview
This dashboard visualizes airline efficiency through insights on on-time performance (OTP), arrival and departure delays, cancellations, and operational hubs. It helps identify patterns that affect reliability and passenger satisfaction.

🎯 Problem Statement
Flight delays and cancellations are a significant issue in the US aviation industry, impacting passengers, airlines, and the economy.
Our task is to perform an in-depth analysis of historical flight data to identify the key drivers of these disruptions, assess airline performance, and propose actionable insights.
The dashboard includes KPI cards with a target OTP of 90%, helping track how far each airline is from its punctuality goal.

💠 Key Metrics
• OTP Rate – Percentage of on-schedule flights (Goal: 90%)
• Arrival Delay – Average arrival delay (minutes)
• Departure Delay – Average departure delay (minutes)

🔍 Key Insights
• OTP rates differ widely; airlines below the 90% target indicate areas for operational improvement.
• ✈️ Emirates is competitive but sometimes falls short of the OTP goal.
• 🌦️ Weather and airline-related issues remain top causes of cancellations, impacting OTP.
• ⏱️ Airlines with longer departure or arrival delays show lower OTP, highlighting bottlenecks.
• 🗺️ Map visuals reveal major hubs; airlines operating through congested airports often struggle to meet the 90% OTP target.
• 📉 Customer journey funnel shows the largest drop from scheduled departures to actual arrivals, emphasizing reliability gaps relative to the OTP goal.

🚀 Future Scope
• Integration of real-time flight data through APIs
• Predictive delay analysis using machine learning to improve OTP
